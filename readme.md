## Physical Materials

To house our whole design, we use a 1.5 in PVC tube. The hilt of the tube is removable so that we can replace batteries when needed and update the Arduino. The overall main electronics are compactly snugged into the PVC.

The saber pipe part where the RGB LEDs are stored is made from Methacrylate Polycarbonate, a semi-opaque material which is able to diffuse RGB LED Light.
